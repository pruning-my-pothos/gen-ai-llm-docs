# Experiment: [Experiment Name]

:::info[Hypothesis]
We believe that [doing X] with [Model Y] will result in [Outcome Z].
:::

## Context

- **Goal**: [What are we trying to prove or solve?]
- **Tools**: [e.g., Cursor, Copilot, Local Llama 3]
- **Constraints**: [e.g., No internet access, strict time limit]

---

## The Setup

Briefly describe the environment and inputs.

- **Input Artifacts**: [e.g., Intent Spec v0.1]
- **Prompt Strategy**: [e.g., Chain of thought, direct delegation]

---

## Execution Log

### Attempt 1

**Prompt**:

```text
[Insert prompt here]
```

**Outcome**:

- [ ] Success
- [x] Failure

**Observation**:
The model failed to respect the [specific constraint]. It hallucinated [X].

### Attempt 2 (Correction)

**Adjustment**:
We updated the [Constraint Spec] to explicitly forbid [X].

**Outcome**:

- [x] Success
- [ ] Failure

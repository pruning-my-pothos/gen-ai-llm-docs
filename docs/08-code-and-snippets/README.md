# Code & Snippets

This section is for beginners and non-developers who need to **understand** and occasionally **run** minimal code to make better decisions and debug GenAI/LLM workflows. Everything here is short, annotated, and runnable locally.

## What You'll Find

- Quick setup/install commands (Python/Node, common GenAI libs).
- Git basics for working locally (CLI or VSCode).
- Minimal, copy/paste snippets for tokens, RAG, structured output, safety prompts.
- Troubleshooting tips for common errors.

## How to Use

1. Start with **Setup & Installs** and **Git Basics** to get your environment ready.
2. Use **Token Counting**, **RAG Mini**, and **Structured Output** to understand the core building blocks.
3. Apply **Safety & Prompts** to reduce hallucinations and scope creep.
4. Refer to **Troubleshooting** when something breaks.

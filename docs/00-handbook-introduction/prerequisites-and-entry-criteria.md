# GenAI & LLM Handbook: Prerequisites and Entry Criteria

:::info[Value Proposition]
Formalize the skill gate to prevent Level 0 usage from declaring the GenAI & LLM Handbook “broken.” Establish minimum and recommended prerequisites before applying the GenAI & LLM Handbook.
:::

## Overview

The GenAI & LLM Handbook is a powerful framework, but like any sophisticated tool, it requires a certain level of proficiency to use effectively and safely. This document outlines the prerequisites—both cognitive skills and foundational knowledge—necessary to engage with the GenAI & LLM Handbook in a professional context. Attempting to apply the GenAI & LLM Handbook without meeting these criteria often leads to frustration, suboptimal results, and an inaccurate perception of the framework's capabilities.

**Goal**: Ensure users have the foundational skills and knowledge to benefit from the GenAI & LLM Handbook.
**Anti-pattern**: Expecting AI to compensate for a lack of human skill or understanding, leading to "garbage in, garbage out" scenarios.

## Self-Check: Can You Apply the GenAI & LLM Handbook Safely?

Ask yourself these questions before starting any GenAI & LLM Handbook task:

-   Can I articulate the exact intent and desired outcome of this task?
-   Can I list all non-negotiable constraints (technical, security, business)?
-   Do I understand the system context where this change will live?
-   Can I define clear, objective acceptance criteria for the output?
-   Am I prepared to critically review the AI's output and take full accountability?

If you answer "No" to any of these, pause and strengthen that area.

## Entry Criteria

To begin applying the GenAI & LLM Handbook effectively:

-   You **MUST** be able to articulate the [Intent Spec](/docs/01-handbook-method/intent-spec) for your task.
-   You **MUST** be able to define the [Constraint Spec](/docs/01-handbook-method/constraint-spec) for your task.
-   You **MUST** understand the need for evidence-based verification.
-   You **MUST** accept full accountability for the outcome of AI-assisted work.

If you are just starting your journey, focus on building these foundational skills. Re-enter the GenAI & LLM Handbook after you can produce: intent, constraints, review plan, and evidence.

## Beyond the Basics

Prerequisites include **both cognitive/process skills and minimum GenAI literacy**. The GenAI & LLM Handbook assumes you understand probabilistic behavior, context limits, and the necessity of verification before shipping.

## Next Steps

Review the [Standard Core](./standard-core.md) documents for the minimal set of documents required to apply the GenAI & LLM Handbook effectively.

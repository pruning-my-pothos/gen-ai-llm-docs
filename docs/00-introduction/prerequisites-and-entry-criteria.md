# GenAI & LLM Documentation Prerequisites and Entry Criteria

:::info[Value Proposition]
Formalize the skill gate to prevent Level 0 usage from declaring GenAI & LLM Documentation “broken.” Establish minimum and recommended prerequisites before applying GenAI & LLM Documentation.
:::

## Overview

GenAI & LLM Documentation is a powerful framework, but like any sophisticated tool, it requires a certain level of proficiency to use effectively and safely. This document outlines the prerequisites—both cognitive skills and foundational knowledge—necessary to engage with GenAI & LLM Documentation in a professional context. Attempting to apply GenAI & LLM Documentation without meeting these criteria often leads to frustration, suboptimal results, and an inaccurate perception of the framework's capabilities.

**Goal**: Ensure users have the foundational skills and knowledge to benefit from GenAI & LLM Documentation.
**Anti-pattern**: Expecting AI to compensate for a lack of human skill or understanding, leading to "garbage in, garbage out" scenarios.

## When to Use

| ✅ Use This Pattern When...           | 🚫 Do Not Use When...                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| Onboarding new team members to GenAI & LLM Documentation workflows | You are a seasoned GenAI & LLM Documentation practitioner seeking advanced techniques |
| Diagnosing recurring issues with AI-generated outputs | You are looking for a silver bullet to solve all your development problems |
| Establishing a baseline for team proficiency with AI-assisted development | You are purely exploring LLM capabilities without a defined outcome |

## Prerequisites

:::warning[Before you start]
Mastery of these prerequisites is critical for effective and safe GenAI & LLM Documentation adoption.
:::

- **Core Skills**: Proficiency in Logic, Language, Systems, and Sentences (as defined in `docs/01-core-skills/`).
- **GenAI Literacy**: Understanding of LLM capabilities, limitations, and failure modes (e.g., hallucinations, context window limits).
- **Domain Knowledge**: Sufficient understanding of the problem domain and technical stack.

## Self-Check: Can You Apply GenAI & LLM Documentation Safely?

Ask yourself these questions before starting any GenAI & LLM Documentation task:

-   Can I articulate the exact intent and desired outcome of this task?
-   Can I list all non-negotiable constraints (technical, security, business)?
-   Do I understand the system context where this change will live?
-   Can I define clear, objective acceptance criteria for the output?
-   Am I prepared to critically review the AI's output and take full accountability?

If you answer "No" to any of these, pause and strengthen that area.

## Entry Criteria

To begin applying GenAI & LLM Documentation effectively:

-   You **MUST** be able to articulate the Intent Spec for your task.
-   You **MUST** be able to define the Constraint Spec for your task.
-   You **MUST** understand the need for evidence-based verification.
-   You **MUST** accept full accountability for the outcome of AI-assisted work.

If you are just starting your journey, focus on building these foundational skills. Re-enter GenAI & LLM Documentation after you can produce: intent, constraints, review plan, and evidence.

## Beyond the Basics

Prerequisites include **both cognitive/process skills and minimum GenAI literacy**. GenAI & LLM Documentation assumes you understand probabilistic behavior, context limits, and the necessity of verification before shipping.

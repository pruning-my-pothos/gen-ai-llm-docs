## The GenAI & LLM Documentation Mindset

GenAI & LLM Documentation is best understood through application. It is a disciplined approach to managing the interaction between human intent and AI execution.

    B --> C[AI Execution]
    C --> D[Review & Validation]
    D --> B
```

If you adapt GenAI & LLM Documentation:

-   **You must assume AI will try to make sense of ambiguous input**, even if it makes things up.
-   **You must assume AI will take the path of least resistance** if constraints are weak.
-   **You must own the outcome.**

GenAI & LLM Documentation assumes responsibility is non-negotiable.

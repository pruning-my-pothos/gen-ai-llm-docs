# What is GenAI & LLM Documentation?

:::info[Value Proposition]
GenAI & LLM Documentation is for people who want the speed of GenAI **without giving up clarity, correctness, or responsibility.**
:::

## Overview

**GenAI & LLM Documentation (Generative AI & Large Language Model Documentation)** is a professional framework for building software, documentation, and systems using natural language, with AI as an execution partner. It treats language as a **technical interface**, not a chat prompt.

At its core, GenAI & LLM Documentation acknowledges that while AI is excellent at generating plausible outputs, it lacks human judgment, context, and accountability. Most AI failures are not model failures. They are **human specification failures**. GenAI & LLM Documentation exists to fix that.

## What GenAI & LLM Documentation Is (and Is Not)

| GenAI & LLM Documentation Is                                                                                                      | GenAI & LLM Documentation Is Not                                                                                                  |

| - A repeatable method for professional AI-assisted development.                                                                 | - A collection of "prompt engineering" tricks.                                                                                  |
| - A framework for defining intent, constraints, and acceptance criteria.                                                        | - A substitute for human judgment, skill, or accountability.                                                                    |
| - Focused on producing verifiable artifacts (code, docs, designs).                                                              | - A way to generate software without understanding the problem.                                                                 |
| - A system for evidence-based review and interrogation of AI outputs.                                                           | - A tool for automating away critical thinking.                                                                                 |
| - Designed to keep humans in command, AI as a disciplined tool.                                                                 | - Magic. It amplifies your discipline, or your lack thereof.                                                                    |
| - A way to reduce risk and improve quality in AI-assisted workflows.                                                            | - A replacement for fundamental engineering practices (e.g., testing, code review, architectural design).                       |

GenAI & LLM Documentation formalizes this into a repeatable method.

## How it Works: The GenAI & LLM Documentation Method

GenAI & LLM Documentation defines an 8-step iterative "Loop" that guides AI-assisted work from initial discovery to final acceptance and release. This loop is supported by core skills (Logic, Language, Systems, Sentences) and enforced by a suite of artifacts and templates.

-   Process specification: `docs/03-method/11-genai-llm-loop-spec.md`
-   Artifact contracts: `docs/03-method/12-artifact-contracts.md`
-   Accountability and delegation: `docs/03-method/10-accountability-and-delegation.md`

# Standard Core (GenAI & LLM Documentation)

:::info[Value Proposition]
Use this as the fast entry point to the normative GenAI & LLM Documentation standard. These are the minimal documents required to apply GenAI & LLM Documentation correctly.
:::

## Overview

The GenAI & LLM Documentation standard is comprehensive, but you don't need to read every document to start applying it. This "Standard Core" provides a curated list of essential documents that, when understood and applied, form the bedrock of effective and safe GenAI & LLM Documentation practice.

**Goal**: Provide a minimal, high-impact set of documents for quick adoption of GenAI & LLM Documentation.
**Anti-pattern**: Feeling overwhelmed by the volume of documentation and not knowing where to start.

| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| Quickly onboarding to GenAI & LLM Documentation | You need to deeply understand every nuance of the framework |
| Requiring a compliance checklist for GenAI projects | You are only interested in a specific execution pattern |
| Establishing team-wide consistency for AI-assisted work | You are purely exploring LLM capabilities without a defined outcome |

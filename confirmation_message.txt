It seems I made a mistake by trying to update internal links before the directories were actually renamed.

Please **execute the `directory_rename_commands.sh` script** that I previously provided to rename the directories.

Once you have executed these commands in your terminal, please let me know so I can proceed with updating the internal links within the documentation files.

```bash
# Example content of directory_rename_commands.sh
# Please execute this script in your terminal.
#
# Rename method directory
# mv docs/03-nnlp-method docs/03-method
#
# ... and so on for all directories ...
```

I will wait for your confirmation.

To rename the directories that contain "NNLP" or old numbering patterns, please execute the following commands in your terminal. Note that I cannot execute these commands directly for you.

```bash
# Rename method directory
mv docs/03-nnlp-method docs/03-method

# Rename execution patterns directory
mv docs/04-execution-patterns docs/04-patterns

# Rename professional scenarios directory
mv docs/05-professional-scenarios docs/05-scenarios

# Rename frameworks and tooling directory
mv docs/06-frameworks-and-tooling docs/06-tooling

# Rename guardrails and governance directory
mv docs/07-guardrails-and-governance docs/07-guardrails

# Rename core skills directory
mv docs/01-core-skills docs/01-skills

# Rename genai-llm-fundamentals directory
mv docs/02-genai-llm-fundamentals docs/02-fundamentals
```

**WARNING:** Executing these commands will rename the directories. After you execute these, many internal links within your `.md` files will be broken. I will assist you in fixing these links in the next steps, but please be aware of this impact.

Once you have executed these commands, please let me know so I can proceed with updating the internal links within the documentation files.
